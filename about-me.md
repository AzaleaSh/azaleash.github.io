# About Me

I am driven by a single purpose: to take an abstract idea and make it real. I have a passion for solving complex challenges at the intersection of electrical engineering and astrophysics, not just through technical skill, but by building and empowering teams to turn visions into tangible results.

From a young age, I’ve found a home in the world of robotics. As President of MachBusters FRC, I had the privilege of leading a team of over 25 members through the full design-build-compete cycle. But my time with the team began by pioneering it from the ground up. In our first year, I served as the Business Lead, laying the groundwork for our sustainable growth by starting business projects, building our initial team structure, and successfully securing over $40,000 in funding. I believe tha true innovation requires not only technical ingenuity but also strategic planning and strong leadership.

My drive to explore the "abstract" is equally matched by a desire for discovery. My research mentorships at both The Ohio State University and Northwestern University’s CIERA program allowed me to dive into high-level astronomical research. Using Python for complex data analysis, I’ve worked on projects ranging from understanding black hole X-ray binary accretion discs to researching solar coronal heating mechanisms. I was honored to present this work at ICCMS in Dahab, Egypt, where I received the Best Oral Presentation award.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I believe leadership is about human connection. This past summer, as a Program Leader for a youth development camp, I managed a team of my peers to mentor younger students. This experience grew my belief that the most impactful results come from creating an environment of trust, public speaking, and teamwork, both in and out of the lab.

Now, as I begin my dual degree in Physics and Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I am eager to continue pushing boundaries, whether that’s with the Illinois Space Society or by taking my unique blend of leadership, engineering, and scientific research into the next frontier. :)
