# About Me

Originally from Cincinnati, OH, I'm a freshman at University of Illinois pursuing a dual degree in Physics and Electrical Engineering. My main aspiration is to develop astronomical instrumentation. I have love solving complex challenges at the intersection of electrical engineering and astrophysics, through technical skill and through building and empowering teams.

I’ve always loved the world of robotics. As President of MachBusters FRC for two years, I had the privilege of leading a team of over 25 members through the full design-build-compete cycle for a complex robot around the size of a washing machiene. My time with the team began by building it from the ground up. In our first year, I served as the Business Lead, laying groundwork for our growth by starting business projects, building our initial team structure, and successfully securing over $40,000 through grant funding. After high school, I now volunteer to mentor Ctrl-Z 4096.

My research mentorships at both The Ohio State University and Northwestern University’s CIERA allowed me to work with  high-level astronomical research. Using Python for complex data analysis, I’ve worked on projects ranging from understanding black hole X-ray binary accretion discs to researching solar coronal heating mechanisms. I was honored to present this work at ICCMS in Dahab, Egypt, where I received the Best Oral Presentation award in Physical Sciences.

Beyond my technical work, I believe leadership is really about human connection. This past summer, as a Program Leader for a summer camp in Dayton, Ohio, I managed a team of my peers, while developing activities focused on youth development. This experience taught me that the most impactful results come from creating an environment of trust, public speaking, and teamwork, both in and out of the lab.

As I work on my dual degree in Physics and Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I am eager to continue pushing boundaries. :)
