Hi! Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Azalea, a student from Cincinnati, Ohio, passionate about astronomical engineering. I am motivated by the single act of turning abstract into real. My experience lies in taking ideas and building effective teams in order to solve complex engineering or scientific challenges, and convert them into tangible, high-impact results. I'm here to push the boundaries of what's known while leading, inspiring and empowering others.
