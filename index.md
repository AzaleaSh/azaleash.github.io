Hi! Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Azalea, a student at University of Illinois, passionate about astronomical engineering. I love turning the abstract into real. Particularly by taking ideas and building effective teams in order to solve complex engineering or scientific challenges and converting them into tangible, high-impact results.
